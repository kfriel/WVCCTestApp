A number of years ago VA leadership saw a growing number of women entering the armed forces and questions were rased concerning the male centric nature of the services provided by the VA. In response they created an office of Women's Health Services charged with helping the Veterans Health Administration meet the needs of the growing population of Women Veterans. As part of its work the Women's Health Services leadership became aware of barriers women experienced to gaining access to health care in the VA. They also realized that a large number of Women Veterans were never comming into contact with the VA or simply dropping out after a short time. This raised the key question; are women Veterans who elegable for services, making a choice or in some way being prevented from accessing these services and care. The need for an outreach program was clear.

The Women's Health Services was able to obtain money for an outreach program along with a source for Women Veteran contact information. But getting the out reach program up and running was difficult. The initial effort was pleged with problems including low call volumes, inadiquite reporting and problems with accountability that made it hard to justify the cost of the program. 

Looking for an alternative Women's Health Services heard about a small survey team working out of Canadaguia NY and approached them about their out reach program. Listening closely to the WHS leadership the data collection projects team learned what WHS was trying to do and developed the business systems necessary to make the call center a reality. And helped WHS develop a set of realistic, cost effective and measureable goals. 

Why: In a traditionally male centric institution, Women Veterans should have a clear oportunity to make their own decisions about how to involve the VA in their healthcare to which their service to their country makes them elegable.
